 *
 * PHPcoord
 * phpcoord.php
 *
 * (c) 2005 Jonathan Stott
 *
 * Created on 11-Aug-2005

 * 2.3 - 24 Aug 2006
 *  - Changed OSRef->toSixFigureString() so that the eastings and northings
 *    are rounded rather than floored.
 * 2.2 - 11 Feb 2006
 *  - Used different algorithm for calculating distance between latitudes
 *    and longitudes - fixes a number of problems with distance calculations
 * 2.1 - 22 Dec 2005
 *  - Added getOSRefFromSixFigureReference function
 * 2.0 - 21 Dec 2005
 *  - Completely different object design - conversion functions now through
 *    objects rather than static functions
 *  - Updated comments and documentation
 * 1.1 - 11 Sep 2005
 *  - Added OSGB36/WGS84 data conversions
 * 1.0 - 11 Aug 2005
